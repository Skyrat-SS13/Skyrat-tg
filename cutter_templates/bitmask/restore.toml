# Bitmask restoration!
# Allows for easy mass extraction of template pngs and their configs from a dmi
# Use this if you have a dmi and you want a cutter config you can edit easily
# Of note, while it tries its best it is nowhere near perfect. We don't parity check against the existing dmi
# And we also do not account for overrided states very well
# Always double check (and be aware that dmi is weird so you may get diffs of 1 rgb value when doin this)

# List of icon states to pull out (by default)
extract = ["0", "3", "12", "15", "255"]

# Map of name -> state that will be encoded into a positions list later
# Lets you extract particular states and use them to fill in for states later
# Useful to carry over odd snowflake states
#[bespoke]

# Map of key -> value to set on the created config
# Lets you set arbitrary values on the created config, mostly useful for batch processing
# IMPORTANT NOTE: We sort of assume you'll setup a default template here (since this is for batch processing),
# so if things work odd that's likely why
