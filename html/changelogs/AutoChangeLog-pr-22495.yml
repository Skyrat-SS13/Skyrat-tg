  - refactor: "Arcane Barrage and Blood Barrage are magic gun subtypes and not rifle subtypes. Also they have sprites again."
  - qol: "The barrage spells now use the automatic component to do its thing."
  - bugfix: "Blood Barrage once again heals cultists and constructs without hurting them."
  - code_imp: "Cleans up how Blood Rites finds blood to draw in. You can now just click turfs as well as blood, and it should now be much more accurate about it."
  - qol: "Blood trails contribute to charges gained using Blood Rites. You can also activate Blood Rite's blood draw using blood trails."
