  - bugfix: "Certain items can no longer be purchased or be offered with a discount on a loneop uplink. This is stuff like base cards (functionally useless) or Overwatch Intel Agents (which break the role)."
  - balance: "Loneops may now purchase chameleon noslips, station blackout triggers, and station comms failure triggers."
