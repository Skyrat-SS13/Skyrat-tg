      charge you.
  - bugfix: Multi-shot paywall firing pins do not charge you for agreeing to the initial

      controller, which can be printed from any autolathe and from engineering techfabs
      at roundstart. Use it in-hand to set its channel ID, and then slap it against
      windows with polarization controllers installed to link them to it. Place it

      to activate it, and toggle all connected windows at once.
