  - rscadd: New basketball mechanics that uses stamina.  Shoot with RMB, pass with
      LMB, and dunk by clicking the hoop while adjacent.  Spinning while holding the
      ball decreases the chance for someone to steal the ball, but it decreases your
      shooting accuracy.  Shooting from 2 tiles away lets you score 3 points.
  - qol: Basketballs now play a buzzer sound when someone scores. CtrlClick will reset
      the scorecard and AltClick with a wrench will rotate the hoop.

      with it.
  - balance: Wirecarp no longer tells you what ruins spawned in a round, instead it's
      limited to PDA logs, and tells you the source too. This means the RD can catch
      someone running illegal programs if they don't make any attempt at hiding it.
  - qol: Wirecarp logs is now set to save 300 at once, instead of 100 and being increased
      to 300 by the RD during the round. This is pretty insignificant, since there's
      no reason to NOT want as many logs as possible.

      disks, which hold techweb information on it, just not the one that holds up
      to 5 nodes.
  - balance: ^ Because of this, there's no way to download nodes from an RD console
      and upload them to an Autolathe to bypass departmental restrictions, you have
      to go through a Techfab/Circuit imprinter for your needs.
  - balance: Ones that are found cannot have anything uploaded/deleted off of them
