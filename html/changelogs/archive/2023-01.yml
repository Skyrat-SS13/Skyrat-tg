  - rscadd: Added the Bloodshot drink, being the new racial drink for Hemophages!
      It restores blood at the rate Bloody Mary used to restore blood before this
      update. It's also the intended way to deal with bloodloss via drinks, which
      means it'll also work on those that aren't full on blood! It might gross you
      out if you don't need it, however.
  - rscadd: Added the Taste Suppressor reagent, which allows you to eat food you might
      not like by making you completely unable to taste anything. It's not a great

  - balance: Hemophages can now only eat food and drink reagents (via ingestion) that
