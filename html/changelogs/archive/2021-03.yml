      now (was intended to be changed in the main PR but i forgot)

      head will be met with failure.
  - tweak: adjusted Helbital, Libital, probital, lenturi, aiuri, hercuri, convermol,
      tirimol, seiver, multiver, syriniver, synthflesh and penthrite to better use

      a slapper with *slap, then click on an empty table! Doing so with a left-click
      lets you fire off a series of weaker slaps, while a right-click makes one big,
      loud slam for maximum impact!
  - bugfix: Right clicking someone in combat mode as a hulk will now shove them, like
      it does for normal humans

  - bugfix: powersinks now should be centered on the tile when dropped/thrown
  - code_imp: ontop flag now checks for mobs too

      is supposed to insert a buffer into the reaction.
  - rscadd: Adds plumbing bufferers. Place a bunch of them next to each other, set
      a threshold amount with right click and screwdriver them. Once all are above
      the threshold, only then will they start providing chems. Great for waiting
      steps and carefully dosing amounts!
  - balance: The reaction chamber no longer pulls specific chems, and instead has
      a set volume it works towards before being able to react.
  gonenoculer5:
  - balance: Syndicate contractors will notice that their batons have recieved some
      upgrades, and are now more capable of subduing targets more effectively, only

  Qustinnus:
  - bugfix: You can no longer sentience tourist bots
  - bugfix: Sentient robots are no longer invincible
  SkyratBot:
  - balance: ID cards have now completely changed. ID cards have limited available
      access slots increased by card rarity and the specific job trim. Jobs with more
      innate access now have more valuable ID cards. Better watch your backs!
  - balance: Yes, this means that you can no longer mass-distribute unrestricted All
      Access. During War Ops, you're expected to protect the diskie and disk holder.
      Sec can distribute guns. Cargo can order guns. You can still get key accesses
      like Maint on any ID card. HoP can still create and trim special silver ID cards
      for high value staff members to get more access. Adapt. Overcome. Suffer.
  - balance: Chameleon ID cards are completely reworked. Instead of copying all accesses
      from a card, they now open up an interface where you can select up to 5 accesses
      to copy over depending on the target card's access.
  - tweak: The ID Console has been updated to reflect these new changes including
      a somewhat improved layout. You can apply job templates direct to cards via
      a drop-down interface and these templates will attempt to fill out as many accesses
      on the card as it can based on the card's trim and the template's wildcard setup.
  - tweak: The PDA Painter has now been upgraded with a tgui interface. It can be
      used to paint PDAs the same as before, but can now also change the trim on ID
      cards. This procedure will remove all access levels from the ID card in the
      process, leaving you with a freshly trimmed blank ID card.
  - tweak: 'Captain job trims now have a white star instead of a dull grey star. removed:
      Mining Conscript Card has been removed and replaced with a spare mining ID that
      holds and has the access the Conscript card gave.'
  - tweak: The Captain's Spare ID has been moved from the Captain's locker to a secure
      safe on the bridge. The highest ranking Command member on shift start is given
      the codes to this safe, generally following the chain of command. The QM is
      part of this and can, in exceptional circumstances where no other heads join
      the shift, become Acting Captain. Their ID card would be given Bridge access
      if they were picked as Acting Captain to allow them to access the captain's
      spare. If nobody in the chain of command joins the shift, the next latejoined
      player from the chain of command will be given the codes for the spare and promoted
      to Acting Captain automatically.
  - tweak: The secure safe on the bridge is a special variant that is immune to conventional
      weaponry and lacks the hacking mechanic of ordinary wall safes. Maybe if you
      could examine it close enough, you'd find hints to its weaknesses...
  - tweak: Examining players now shows a more detailed representation of any ID card
      in their ID slot.
  - rscadd: Added the world's worst coder sprites for ID card overlays including PDA,
      Laptop and Wallet icons for when they're in the ID Card slot too. May God have
      mercy on your souls, for my spriting skills have none.

  - imageadd: 'added a dir to the electrified chair overlay feature: make any chair
      into an electrified chair by attaching a shock kit to them over a live cable'
  - spellcheck: fixed typo on the engineering voidsuit
  - bugfix: The Plexagon Access Management app has been upgraded and allows Heads
      of Staff to demote any ID card that has a trim they'd ordinarily be able to
      apply as a template. This means the HoS can now demote departmental sec officers
      like Security Officer (Science).
  - bugfix: A recent firmware update reenabled the screens on Nanotransen brand computers.
  - bugfix: Bloodsplatter no longer experiences phantom limb syndrome on people missing
      both of their arms.
  - bugfix: Recent budget cuts have resulted in accessories no longer having magnets
      strong enough to pull bloodstains directly out of clothing. Washing machine
      usage has jumped 50% over the last week.
  - bugfix: No one is entirely certain who injected the the design schema for neon
      error signs into the mind magnification helmet production line, but the affected
      units have been recalled and the perpetrator <i>will</i> be brought to justice.

  YakumoChen:
  - rscadd: A less-than-new Syndicate Special bundle reminds you of the good old days
      when we didn't need all those newfangled traitor items the young-uns get. We
      had 6 items in the uplink and we had Monkey in rotation and by god we made do.

      medical needed to be worse.
2021-03-05:
  ATHATH:
  - balance: Radioactive microlasers can no longer knock out creatures who are immune
      to the effects of radiation.
  - bugfix: The radioactive microlaser now calculates the strength of its delay effect
      using the intensity setting it had when you initially used it on your victim,
      not the intensity setting it currently has. This prevents people from "cheating
      out" its intensity 20 effect with only a 2 second delay and a 1 second cooldown.
  - balance: Radioactive microlasers no longer contain twice as much metal as normal
      health analyzers do.
  - refactor: The definition of the transfer_blood variable (of gloves) has been moved
      from the file that otherwise only contains the code of damp rags to the file
      that defines the other variables of gloves, and has also been documented.
  ArcaneMusic Ft. Ghost:
  - rscadd: Scanner gates now have a set of wires that interact with assembly components.
      Experiment!

  - rscadd: Adds a new system for handling organ failure, the old system is still
      there for organs that havent been ported yet.

      once it reaches 100 damage (liver is dead) it will give you a 1 minute warning
      period for you to get to medbay, after that 1 minute the effects of liver failure
      will slowly ramp up to comparably old levels of deadliness.

  SkyratBot:
  - bugfix: The new ID card system no longer ignores server config settings and will
      respect lowpop/highpop access settings in the config. This mean that highpop
      shifts no longer grant players lowpop access levels when the appropriate config
      entries are set.
  - config: As I am happy with the status quo, the headmins have agreed to disable
      the config entry that was being ignored due to the above bug. Players should
      not notice any new roundstart ID access changes by the time they're reading
      this changelog entry and will hopefully start with maximum job access at any
      population level because it is intended, rather than because of a bug.

      the bluespace gas network. To this machine will connect gas vendors (or you
      can multitool the sender and then the vendor to do the connection), the vendors
      are wall mounted tank dispensers where you can decide you gas mix based on the

      if no pipe is connected to the red port or there is no gas in it, the heat will
      be moved from the enviroment;
  - balance: ALL the station freezers are now connected to the waste loop, where the
      CO2 gets collected and used to store that heat (atmos should now manage the
