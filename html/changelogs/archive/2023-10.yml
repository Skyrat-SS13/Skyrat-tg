  - bugfix: fixed some faulty research connections in between heretic's blade and
      rust paths.
  - bugfix: Heretic mobs will not be summoned with AI enabled, and won't turn into
      small animals instead of summoning a flesh stalker.

      showing as selected

  - bugfix: you can no longer polymorph belt into a holoparasite
  - refactor: Revenants, the mob that's split between planes of Life and Death, have
      been refactored into a basic mob. While this alone shouldn't touch behavior,
      a lot of the backend code has been gutted and refactored to try and furnish
      a better antagonist experience. This might mean that some weird stuff can come
      up and around, report something if it's utterly broken.
  - code_imp: In order to better facilitate some code, you do not ghost outside of
      a revenant on death, you simply get transferred into the ectoplasm. You should
      still be able to speak with your ghost friends on how hard you got wrecked or
      if you'll be able to resurrect though.
  - code_imp: The timing on revenant stuff such as being revealed, stunned, and inhibited
      (by holy weapons) should be tweaked a bit to allow better management. This should
      mean that getting unstunned and such should be a bit more precise now.

      will now actually do something.
  - qol: Adds a base physical description proc to gameplay species, displays it on
      magic mirrors. It will give a description of not the lore of the species but
      in what way they differ from base species.
  - bugfix: Fixes a bad subtype on magical mirrors.
  - bugfix: Magical mirrors now give the user ADVANCEDTOOLUSER and LITERACY if they
      lack either of them, so monkey wizards aren't softlocked.

  - balance: Unholy water acts as a coagulant for cultists.
  - bugfix: bitrunners will no longer be lumped in with assistants on the crew monitor
      console's display
  - bugfix: count station food verb now counts food only onstation
  - bugfix: Antiglow now probably has negative glow power.
  - refactor: Harvester constructs have been updated to the basic mob framework. This
      should have very little impact on their behavior, but please report any issues.
  - bugfix: Fixes a few runtimes with TTS and skips some code if TTS isn't enabled.
  - sound: Add burning sound loop to bonfires and fireplaces
  - code_imp: Improved fireplaces to only process when lit

      variant, a sec-vest variant, and a marine variant.
  - image: Blueshield's earpiece is no longer a bright blue tumor on the side of their
      head.

  - bugfix: plumbing setups will no longer output 0 or more than maximum available
      volume of reagents.
  - bugfix: removing, copying, transfering reagents is now done proportionally and
      not equally again.
  - refactor: examining individual reagents up close will display their volumes up
      to 4 decimal places for accuracy.
  - qol: droppers & beakers round the amount of reagents transferred before displaying
      them to chat for easy readibility
  - sound: the blood cult's rise to power is now accompanied by several new sound
      effects
  - rscadd: Adds a new lavaland ruin where you can find a unique egg.
  - image: you can now change the style of lipstick to be higher or lower on the face
      by alt-clicking the lipstick tube
  - balance: Flesh Spiders heal automatically over time if they go a short time without
      taking damage, instead of healing large chunks by clicking themselves and waiting
      two seconds.
  - qol: Spider egg clusters which only hatch into one kind of spider don't ask you
      to select that one type from a radial menu with one option on it.
  - qol: As a Flesh Spider, the game now tells you how you can heal yourself.
  - bugfix: You cannot order with cargo budget if you don't have cargo access in the
      Galactic Market
  - bugfix: Private & Cargo orders no longer get mixed together in the same crate
      if you order them interchangeably so no more embezzlement in the Galactic Market
  - bugfix: Orders made with cargo budget come in a regular cargo crate thus allowing
      you to open them without QM cargo budget card in the Galactic Market
  - qol: Orders made in the Galactic Market will deduct money from your account/cargo
      budget only after the order has been confirmed in the cargo request console
      & after the shuttle arrives with your order. This way you drain the budget only
      after your orders were successfully delivered and not before hand itself

  - admin: It's now easier to give handless mobs hands by applying the "dextrous"
      element.
  - balance: Spiders and Bears can now climb railings (you know if... they'd rather
      do that than destroy them).
  - refactor: venus human traps are basicmobs now
  - balance: venus human traps have 100 health
  - balance: venus human traps take damage out of range of kudzu, heal near kudzu,
      are slightly slower, attack slower, and their damage output is slightly more
      random
  - balance: also venus human trap tangle ability now needs you to actually move backwards
      to pull victims
  - admin: Gondola supplypods are functional again.
  - bugfix: Examining twice experiment handlers with an active fish-related experiment
      now gives a comprehensible, correctly spaced list of scanned species rather
      than something like "pufferfishguppyslimefishchasmchrab".
  - bugfix: No more "line snapped" balloon messages everytime the fishing minigame
      is over
  - bugfix: Getting to the Master level of the fishing skill now correctly gives you
      that slight helping hand to identify yet-to-be-caught fishes.

  Hatterhat:
  - bugfix: The CIN replicator medipen pouch and pocket first-aid kit no longer have
      bag-like functionality (scooping/the action button), which they didn't need
      to fit in your pockets anyway.
  - balance: First-aid pouches (the ones through Cargo for 300 cr) now have five slots;
      one up from four.
  - rscadd: Ammo pouches can now be reskinned into casing pouches, which let them
      hold ten individual shell casings in your pocket. Yes, this includes shotgun
      shells. This is also primarily intended for shotgun users.
  - spellcheck: .50 BMG surplus, incendiary, and marksman have now been given more
      SR-lore-accurate names.
  - bugfix: 10mm Reaper can't be printed in ammo benches like it was intended. If
