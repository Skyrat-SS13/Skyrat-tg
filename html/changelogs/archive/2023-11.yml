      if lighting changes are required
  Melbert:
  - qol: Clicking on an adjacent dense object (or mob) with Spray Cleaner will now
      spritz it rather than doing nothing. This means you can use Spray Cleaner to
      clean bloodied windows, as the janitor gods intended. It also means you can
      fill a spray bottle with Napalm, I guess.
  - refactor: Any cleaning object can now clean a microwave.
  NotDhu:
  - bugfix: Blueshift's white ship docking port should now work correctly.
  OrionTheFox:

      budget & if it exceeds the available materials on the market. Galactic material

  - rscdel: Remove duplicate light in battlecruiser starfury
  - refactor: Pirate NPCs now use the basic mob framework. They'll be a little smarter

      price of 14 TC.
  - qol: All Syndicate MODsuits come with the potent ability to wear hats on their
      helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by their bald
      helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing
      a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives
      prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
  - qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of gear for
      success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss

      their baseline equipment NOW.

      extinguished.

      want to get a different wing variant.
  - rscdel: Remove duplicate space heater from snowcabin ruin
  - bugfix: Bitrunners can no longer get mass-mindswapped out of their avatar when
      the wizard does the event. Something about machinery and magic not going well
      together.

  - bugfix: Lethal ballistic pellet-based shotgun shells no longer instantly delete.
  - bugfix: Practice laser carbines can no longer be used to rapidly fire regular

      shuttle

      well.
