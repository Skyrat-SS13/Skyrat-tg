  - qol: 'I didn''t update the changelog in the initial PR so i''ll add this here:
      Antags can unlock a final objective (like romerol) that instructs them to cause
      a cascade. The objective will provide a destabilizing crystal that once applied
      to the SM will instantly cause it to start delaminating and sets the SM for
      a cascade. Once it delaminates it ensures the start of the cascade. NOTE that
      if the SM recovers you won''t be able to do it again.'

      supermatter cascade will not, in fact, destroy the entire universe - only an

  - code_imp: 'The confusion status effect is now based on duration (seconds) instead

      code.
  - code_imp: Flashing code is now slightly better.
  - refactor: Jitterriness is now a status effect
