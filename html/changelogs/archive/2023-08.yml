  GoldenAlpharex:
  - rscadd: A Hemophage's pulsating tumor will now corrupt nearby internal organs,
      hijacking them for its own purposes... Meaning that a Hemophage's organs (outside

  - qol: Corrupted organs now decay 10 times slower when no tumor is present in their
      body, taking around 100 seconds instead of 10 to fully decay. That means you

      not that much.

      granted that it spent at least some time in an alive person's body between the

      behavior to the actual organs, meaning that the species itself doesn't handle

  - balance: Scrapheap shuttle can only be bought if the Cargo budget is below 600

      rifle, which has a scope on it, their main weapon now has a scope.

      Gotten from tgmc from https://github.com/tgstation/TerraGov-Marine-Corps/pull/12280.

      - when one is armed, disarmed, or detonating, it says an unique line. Players

      have been changed, the RC Makarov, pp-95, associated ammo for both of those,

      on tg, where they come in a case with a 20/80 percent chance to spawn either
      a good, normal rifle/a rifle that can jam on occasion. All items in the crate
      now have an equal chance of spawning when picked from, aside from the gun cases

      of just sit there as you beat them to death. The framework for them interacting
      with stuff (i.e. opening doors while slobbering on food) is a bit more unified
      too, now. They also have cooler names too!

      disjointed, making it easier to interface with. If you're having issues with
      your Donator status, simply reconnect and that should fix it!
  - config: Added three separate configs for forcing the usage of the legacy Donator,
      Mentor and Veteran systems, defaulting to on (so this should hopefully not change
      anything on servers that have not done any migration yet).

      in nearly all companies due to not quite fitting anymore, or missing where I

      in the Sound category of the game preferences.
  - bugfix: Compact fishing toolboxes no longer break space and time to contain any
      normal-sized object. Instead, they only break space and time to contain fishing
      rods. Settlers migrating to Nanotrasen space have no reasonable explanation
      for this phenomenon.
