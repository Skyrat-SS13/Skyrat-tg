2023-08-03:
  GoldenAlpharex:
  - rscadd: A Hemophage's pulsating tumor will now corrupt nearby internal organs,
      hijacking them for its own purposes... Meaning that a Hemophage's organs (outside
      of the tumor itself) can be replaced by any other organs of the same kind, and
      after a minute, get corrupted and become functional Hemophage organs again.
  - qol: Corrupted organs now decay 10 times slower when no tumor is present in their
      body, taking around 100 seconds instead of 10 to fully decay. That means you
      finally have time to deal with it before the organs are fully dead, but still
      not that much.
  - qol: A Hemophage's pulsating tumor can now be coronary-bypassed more than once,
      granted that it spent at least some time in an alive person's body between the
      two bypasses! Yay for regeneration!
  - bugfix: Hemophage's corrupted organs no longer start rapidly decaying after going
      through the SAD, getting your preferences re-applied or otherwise even getting
      ahealed.
  - refactor: Hemophage code has been severely refactored, moving all of the organ-specific
      behavior to the actual organs, meaning that the species itself doesn't handle
      Hemophage-specific bodily functions anymore. Yay for customizability!
  - code_imp: Hemophage code has been better spread out across multiple files, to
      be easier to sift through and find exactly what you want.
