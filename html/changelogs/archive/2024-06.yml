  - qol: Added screentips to wall buttons.
  - qol: You can now take out the airlock electronics or assembly device out of wall
      buttons individually. Left click prioritises the board, right click prioritises
      the device.
  - qol: Wall buttons are renamable with a pen when opened.
  - qol: Attempting to wrench deconstruct a wall button or put in airlock electronics
      or an assembly device when you can't actually gives feedback.
