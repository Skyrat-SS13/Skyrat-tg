  - balance: Wearing a mask can now prevent you from being spread airborne diseases.
      Prior, it only stopped you from spreading it yourself.

      others people - it now scales on the masks BIO armor. Get a sterile mask from
      Medical for max safety.

      than wearing a mask to prevent spread to yourself - Mask up for the greater
      good!

      remove the limping from fractured bones. (canes do that now too) They're also
      a fairly decent bludgeon. However, they do nothing if both legs are cut off.

      drake is hitting you slightly less hard because of the talismans? You be the
      judge.
  - balance: Goliath cloaks come fully upgraded. However...
  - balance: The recipes for bone armor and goliath cloaks are slightly different.
