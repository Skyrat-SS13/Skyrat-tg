  - balance: most diseases can now be slowed, mitigated, and eventually cured through
      being well-fed, resting, and using spaceacillin. Curing diseases through this
      way will give you immunity if you experience them at their peak/maximum and

  - balance: disease symptoms can be forestalled for up to 100 cycles with a declining
      chance of avoiding them over time using rest or spaceacillin.
  - balance: This does not apply to things like fungal TB; it does apply to healing
      viruses if you don't take care of yourself by staying fed and avoiding spaceacillin.

      However, curing disease in this way does not provide lasting immunity. You need
      to naturally beat the virus or get a vaccine for that.

      the spread of respiratory illnesses from yourself to others. Contact transmission
      is still possible however.

      pharmacy access.

      on their stealth stat to help make up for early outing without a bit more testing.
  - balance: biohazard lockers now also contain a syringe of spaceacillin (in line
      with the orderable kit from cargo.)
  - balance: Virus severity is now also a function of the number of symptoms out of
      max your virus has. Experiment with different combinations using less than six
      symptoms to make viruses that are deceptively less-obvious and less quick to
      self-cure at the tradeoff of stats.
  - admin: Object Possession has been reworked, please report any potential bugs.
  - qol: Object Possession should now throw a screen alert for you to unpossess the
      object instead of you having to search the stat-panel for the "release obj"
      verb. You can still use the verb but it's a lot nicer now. Aghosting will also
      work now.
  - bugfix: fixed big rice pans getting worse with cooking.

2023-12-12:
  Melbert:

      surgery, BUT BEFORE the item's own interactions. As an example, this means using
      a mesh on a mob will attempt to progress surgery first, then attempt to fix
      any burn wounds, then heal burn damage.
