  - balance: most diseases can now be slowed, mitigated, and eventually cured through
      being well-fed, resting, and using spaceacillin. Curing diseases through this
      way will give you immunity if you experience them at their peak/maximum and

  - balance: disease symptoms can be forestalled for up to 100 cycles with a declining
      chance of avoiding them over time using rest or spaceacillin.

      viruses if you don't take care of yourself by staying fed and avoiding spaceacillin.

  - balance: biohazard lockers now also contain a syringe of spaceacillin (in line
      with the orderable kit from cargo.)
  - balance: Virus severity is now also a function of the number of symptoms out of
      max your virus has. Experiment with different combinations using less than six
      symptoms to make viruses that are deceptively less-obvious and less quick to
      self-cure at the tradeoff of stats.
  - admin: Object Possession has been reworked, please report any potential bugs.
  - qol: Object Possession should now throw a screen alert for you to unpossess the
      object instead of you having to search the stat-panel for the "release obj"
      verb. You can still use the verb but it's a lot nicer now. Aghosting will also
      work now.
  - bugfix: fixed big rice pans getting worse with cooking.

2023-12-12:
  Melbert:
  - bugfix: When using an item on a mob, you will always attempt to fix wounds AFTER

      any burn wounds, then heal burn damage.

  - bugfix: Crabs will properly only target Tiny creatures
  - qol: For admins, in the "Spawn Atom" window where you pick atoms to spawn-by-type,
      anything that is a subtype of `/mob/living/basic` should now be replaced with
      the `BASIC` tag instead (like with carbons, reagent containers, turfs, etc.).
      So, instead of having to scroll through and try and figure out what that weird
      subtype of Poly is, it should now be easier to read in that smaller screen.
  - server: The TGS -> Discord Relay Warning that detects if a cliented mob has a
      null loc should now be plaintext instead of being fully screwed up with useless
