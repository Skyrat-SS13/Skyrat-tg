  GoldenAlpharex:
  - bugfix: Chat highlights now escape special RegEx characters from non-RegEx highlights.
  - bugfix: Broken RegEx expressions no longer cause the chat to bluescreen, allowing
      you to properly fix them.
  - bugfix: Clothes equipped in the jumpsuit slot that happen to cover your feet will
      no longer get bloody when you walk over blood if you are also wearing shoes.
      Your kilt won't be getting bloody instantly anymore, it only will if you take
      your shoes off!
  Melbert:
  - refactor: Refactored chameleon actions a fair bit
  - rscadd: Adds outfit saving to chameleon clothes. RMB the "chameleon outfit" action
      to save your current chameleon setup for quick swapping.
  - rscadd: Swapping between chameleon outfits now has a slight "animation" associated,
      to distinguish traitors from lings slightly.
  - rscadd: Adds a new chameleon item, the "Chameleon Scanner". Use it on other crewmembers
      to stealthily save their current outfit as a custom outfit to use later. And
      of course, it's chameleon too.
  - bugfix: Ethereals, the DNA lock mod, GPSs, and storage items now respect EMP protection
  SkyratBot:
  - bugfix: Using the timeline jumper MOD module updates stamina after resetting it,
      no more infinite stamcrits
  - bugfix: fixed a bug that would cause pAIs to be able to break their leash
  - qol: pAIs now try to stay within range of their owner, and teleport back only

      during the market crash event.
  - balance: The market crash event now stands as it's own separate event, and ramps
      up the cost of vendor items until finally popping and returning to normal. Market
      crash now lasts longer to have more impact while it scales with time.
  - balance: The bluespace MOD storage can now hold bulky storage items (backpacks,
      toolbelts) just like the bag of holding.
