/**
 * Called after an item is placed in a lewd slot via the interaction menu. This gets called after equipped() does.
 *
 * Use this instead of equipped() when dealing with lewd slots. We really should hook this better into the upstream
 * equip chain but for now this will have to do.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * user is mob that equipped it
 * * slot(s) that item is equipped to
 * * initial is used to indicate whether or not this is the initial equipment (job datums etc) or just a player doing it
