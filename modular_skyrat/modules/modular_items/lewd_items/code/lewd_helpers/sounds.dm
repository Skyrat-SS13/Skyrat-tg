/**
 * play_lewd_sound is similar to `playsound` but it does not pass through walls, doesn't play for ghosts, and checks for prefs.
 * This is useful if we have something like the organic interface content, which everyone may not want to hear.
 *
 * source - Origin of sound.
 * soundin - Either a file, or a string that can be used to get an SFX.
 * vol - The volume of the sound, excluding falloff and pressure affection.
 * vary - bool that determines if the sound changes pitch every time it plays.
 * extrarange - modifier for sound range. This gets added on top of SOUND_RANGE.
 * falloff_exponent - Rate of falloff for the audio. Higher means quicker drop to low volume. Should generally be over 1 to indicate a quick dive to 0 rather than a slow dive.
 * frequency - playback speed of audio.
 * channel - The channel the sound is played at.
 * pressure_affected - Whether or not difference in pressure affects the sound (E.g. if you can hear in space).
 * falloff_distance - Distance at which falloff begins. Sound is at peak volume (in regards to falloff) aslong as it is in this range.
 * pref_to_check - the path of the pref that we want to check
