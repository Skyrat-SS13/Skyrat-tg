	hi. you might think this is egregious. five slots? that's a lot!
	here's a thought: the pocket first aid kit from the colonial replicator [modular_skyrat\modules\food_replicator\code\storage.dm] has
	mostly unrestricted storage, limited by having 4 max total storage, so at best you're only fitting 4 tiny items. but that's 4 of *any* tiny item.
	or 2 small items (that aren't guns/mags). so it's basically just turning 1 pocket slot into 2, if you think about it hard enough.
	this is a thing you have to buy from cargo's goodies tab. not even an import. and it only fits medical supplies.
	i think it can have a lil extra storage as a treat.
