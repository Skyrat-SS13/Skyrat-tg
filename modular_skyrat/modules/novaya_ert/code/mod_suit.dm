	while leaving place for other modules; yet due to its lack of energy dissipation systems, making its user more vulnerable against conventional laser weaponry. \
	Built-in projectile trajectory and munition assistance computer informs the operator of better places to aim, as well as the remaining munitions for \
	the currently held weapon and its magazines. This function is quite straining on the power cell, and as such, this suit is rarely seen outside of the fortified positions or humanitarian missions; \
	becoming the sign of what little hospitality and assistance the military can provide. However many people who had an experience with this MOD describe it as \"Very uncomfortable.\", \
	mainly due to its lack of proper environmental regulation systems. But because of its protective capabilities, extreme mass-production and cheap price, it easily became the main armor system of the NRI DC."
