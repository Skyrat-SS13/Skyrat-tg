## Modular Slots

Sadly, there's no easy way to sort this code into master_files without fragmenting it and making it virtually impossible to find, so it's staying in this folder.

Do not just copy and paste this folder elsewhere, you will break shit. Edit the files instead, and document your added slot module ID, as well as the define file you added for your slot in the README in the folder above this one.

## How to Add a Slot
Follow the instructions in the DM files here.
Also make sure to add defines into the SKYRAT defines folder.
