## Title: Pixel shifting for RP positioning

MODULE ID: OVERSIZED

### Description:

Adds a veteran-crew locked perk that makes your sprite much larger with some associated upsides and downsides.

### Code Embargo:

Anything that could be perceived as a balance or feature change directly to the oversized quirk, be it code in this module or elsewhere in the code, must be passed by the maintainers prior to PRing, or else your PR risks being closed.
