			Let's start right from the beginning: what is Xenoarchaeology?<br> \
			Great question! Xenoarchaeology is the study of ancient foreign bodies that are trapped within strange rocks.<br> \
			Your goal as a xenoarchaeologist is to find these strange rocks and unearth the secrets that are held within.<br> \
			You will find that these rocks are plentiful throughout the astronomical bodies that we typically orbit.<br> \
			<br> \
			<b>Tools of the Trade</b><br> \
			<br> \
			There are plenty of tools that are required (and some just for the quality of life for the xenoarchaeologist).<br> \
			There are the hammers, the brushes, the tape, the belt, the bag, the handheld machines, and the machines.<br> \
			In this line of work, the brushes and hammers will be the bread and butter.<br> \
			They will allow you to unearth the foreign bodies held within the strange rocks.<br> \
			The hammers (with varying depths) allow you to reach the depths in a faster manner than the brushes.<br> \
			The brushes allow you to uncover the items within the proper depths without damaging it.<br> \
			The tape will allow you to tag the strange rock with the current depth. Continue to examine the rock for updates.<br> \
			The belt will allow you to store your mobile/handheld tools for easy access.<br> \
			The bag will allow you to store and automatically pickup strange rocks that you find lying on the floor.<br> \
			The handheld machines allow you to not have to be stuck at the machines. There are only handheld scanners and recoverers.<br> \
			The Scanner is a machine which allows you to tag the strange rock with its max and safe depth.<br> \
			The Researcher is a machine that allows you to compile/condense relics and items into larger strange artifacts.<br> \
			The Recoverer is a machine that allows you to recover long lost objects from broken items.<br> \
			<br> \
			<b>The Process</b><br> \
			<br> \
			1) Find yourself a strange rock out in the wilderness.<br> \
			2) Go back (or stay) to the xenoarchaeology labratory.<br> \
			3) Process the rock in the scanner (or use the handheld scanner).<br> \
			4) Use the measuring tape on the rock.<br> \
			5) Subtract the safe depth (SD) from the max depth (MD).<br> \
				5a) QUESTION: What is the depth you dig <i>to</i> when the MD is 50 and the SD is 16?<br> \
					ANSWER: 34. Just make sure to not dig 34 as there will be previous depth involved.<br> \
			6) Subtract the current depth (CD) from the answer to step 5.<br> \
			7) Use the hammers to dig the answer to step 6.<br> \
			8) Once you've reached the answer to step 5, use the brush until you reveal the item.<br> \
			9) Enjoy the use of your unearthed secret!<br> \
				9a) If it is a useless relic, sell it or use it in the Researcher for a surprise.<br> \
				9b) If it is a broken item, sell it or use it in the Recoverer for a surprise.<br> \
			<br> \
			I hope this has been helpful and I wish you great success!<br> \
