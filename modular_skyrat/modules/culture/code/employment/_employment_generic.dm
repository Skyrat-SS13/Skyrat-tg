	You are from one of the myriad space stations, orbital platforms, long haul freighters, \
	gateway installations or other facilities that occupy the vastness of space. \
	Spacers near the core worlds of an item are typically accustomed to life in the fast lane, constantly moving between \
	places, meeting a myriad of people and experiencing many of the cultures in your empire. \
	As such, Spacers of the core systems tend to be busy, sociable and mobile, rarely satisfied with settled life. \
	They almost universally know how to live and work in the void and take to such jobs more readily than their planet-bound counterparts. \
	Somehow you've ended up in this hellhole. Maybe the pay was too good to ignore? Or maybe you have family that moved here."

	Raised on one of the long haul freighters that move between frontier worlds delivering vital goods, \
	a lonely outpost on the edge of a dreary backwater, such people are raised in small, confined environments with few others, \
	and tend to be most familiar with older, reliable but outdated technology. \
	An independent sort, people on the frontier are more likely to be isolationist and self-driven."
