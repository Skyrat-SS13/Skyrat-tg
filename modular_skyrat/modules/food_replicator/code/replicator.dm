		as the NRI. The Gencrate is at its core a matter resequencer, a highly specialized subtype of biogenerator which performs a sort of transmutation using organic \
		compounds; normally from large-scale crops or waste product. With sufficient supply, the machine is capable of making a wide variety of provisions, \
	from clothes to food to first-aid medical supplies."
