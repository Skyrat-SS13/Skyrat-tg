		Comfortable and lightweight, the purpose of this cap has gradually shifted to becoming yet another method to flex rank. \n\n\
		Threaded gold is often seen in the campaign cords attached to it, and the emblems on them grow more and more complex based on ranking; \
		and of course, importance to the King."

		Combining ideas from both the NRI and the Old Principalities, this cloneleather cap was made to be both inexpensive and easier to maintain than the elaborate headpieces worn by the older nobility. \
		Border princes of all make and model are known to put their own personal emblems on these instead of any coherent ranking system, \
		and the cap features a wider brim in order to shield Azulean eyes from the alien suns they intend to grasp."
