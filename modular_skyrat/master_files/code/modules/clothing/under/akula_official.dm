		These outfits are known to normally be accessorized with gold trims and other rare metals, \
		constructed and treated specially for use in underwater environments; the dwellings of most of the crown's old guard. \n\n\
		Actual fish-leather is often used for the subtle pattern of scaling, and to ensure proper hydrodynamics while swimming. \
		Due to being constructed for comfort and flash rather than practicality, the technology used in Shoredresses to hydrate the wearer could not be implemented; \
		only a mount for a Shoredress's helm."

		Few decorations are normally seen in these clothing, owing to the tendency of their wearers to 'gallivant.' \
		Due to being constructed for a degree of expendability, the technology used in Shoredresses to hydrate the wearer is \
