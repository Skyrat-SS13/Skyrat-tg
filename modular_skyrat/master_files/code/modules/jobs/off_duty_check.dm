/**
 * Checks is the parent mob is currently off duty. Returns `FALSE` if the mob isn't clocked out.
 *
 * Arguements
 * * `whitelisted_deparments` - This list contains the paths of `/datum/job_department`s we want to check if the parent mob is part of.
 * If present, we will only check if the mob is off-duty if they are a member of one of the departments in the list
 * Otherwise, if we have nothing in the list, we will check all departments
 * * `blacklisted_jobs` - This is a list that contains paths of the `/datum/job`s that we will always return `TRUE` for
 * This typically applies for jobs like assistant where clock status probably wouldn't really matter.
