	/// An associative list of list of rows to add to a database table with the name of the target table as a key.
	/// Used to queue up log entries for bigger queries that happen less often, to reduce the strain on the server caused by
	/// hundreds of additional queries constantly trying to run.
	var/list/queued_log_entries_by_table = list()


/**
 * This is a proc to hopefully mitigate the effect of a large influx of queries needing to be created
 * for something like SQL-based game logs. The goal here is to bundle a certain amount of those log
 * entries together (default is 100, but it depends on the `SQL_GAME_LOG_MIN_BUNDLE_SIZE` config
 * entry) before sending them, so that we can massively reduce the amount of lag associated with
 * logging so many entries to the database.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * table - The name of the table to insert the log enty into.
 * * log_entry - Associative list representing all of the information that needs to be logged.
 * Default format is as follows, for the `game_log` table (even if this could be used for another table):
 * 	list(
 * 		"datetime" = ISOtime(),
 * 		"round_id" = "[GLOB.round_id]",
 * 		"ckey" = key_name(src),
 * 		"loc" = loc_name(src),
 * 		"type" = message_type,
 * 		"message" = message,
 * 	)
 * Take a look at `/atom/proc/log_message()` for an example of implementation.
