// This file contains experimental flags that may not be production ready yet,
// but that we want to be able to easily flip as well as run on CI.
// Any flag you see here can be flipped with the `-D` CLI argument.
// For example, if you want to enable EXPERIMENT_MY_COOL_FEATURE, compile with -DEXPERIMENT_MY_COOL_FEATURE

// EXPERIMENT_MY_COOL_FEATURE
// - Does something really cool, just so neat, absolutely banging, gaming and chill
