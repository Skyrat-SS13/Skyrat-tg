/**
 * log_wound() is for when someone is *attacked* and suffers a wound. Note that this only captures wounds from damage, so smites/forced wounds aren't logged, as well as demotions like cuts scabbing over
 *
 * Note that this has no info on the attack that dealt the wound: information about where damage came from isn't passed to the bodypart's damaged proc. When in doubt, check the attack log for attacks at that same time
 * TODO later: Add logging for healed wounds, though that will require some rewriting of healing code to prevent admin heals from spamming the logs. Not high priority
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * victim- The guy who got wounded
 * * suffered_wound- The wound, already applied, that we're logging. It has to already be attached so we can get the limb from it
 * * dealt_damage- How much damage is associated with the attack that dealt with this wound.
 * * dealt_wound_bonus- The wound_bonus, if one was specified, of the wounding attack
 * * dealt_bare_wound_bonus- The bare_wound_bonus, if one was specified *and applied*, of the wounding attack. Not shown if armor was present
 * * base_roll- Base wounding ability of an attack is a random number from 1 to (dealt_damage ** WOUND_DAMAGE_EXPONENT). This is the number that was rolled in there, before mods
