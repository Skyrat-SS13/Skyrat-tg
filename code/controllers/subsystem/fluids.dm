/**
 * # Fluid Subsystem
 *
 * A subsystem that processes the propagation and effects of a particular fluid.
 *
 * Both fluid spread and effect processing are handled through a carousel system.
 * Fluids being spread and fluids being processed are organized into buckets.
 * Each fresh (non-resumed) fire one bucket of each is selected to be processed.
 * These selected buckets are then fully processed.
 * The next fresh fire selects the next bucket in each set for processing.
 * If this would walk off the end of a carousel list we wrap back to the first element.
 * This effectively makes each set a circular list, hence a carousel.
