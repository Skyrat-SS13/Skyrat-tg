/**
 * The order in which these lists are defined matters. When attempting to add a wildcard access to a card
 * and not specifying an explicit wildcard slot in which to include it, the code will iterate over the list
 * and stop at the first wildcard flag that can hold the access.
 *
 * The lower level the access, the earlier in the list it should be so that low level wildcards get
 * added to the lowest wildcard flag that can take them.

 * A limit of -1 means infinite slots. The system is designed to reject a wildcard when the slot limit
 * explicitly equal 0 for all compatible wildcard slots.
