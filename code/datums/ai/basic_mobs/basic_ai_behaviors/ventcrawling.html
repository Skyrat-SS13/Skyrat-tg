Jolly good times.
This also assumes that we are on the turf that the vent outlet is on. If it isn't, shit.
Warning: this was really snowflake code lifted from an obscure feature that likely has not been touched for over five years years.
Something that isn't implemented is the ability to actually crawl through vents ourselves because I think that's just a waste of time for the same effect (instead of psuedo-teleportation, do REAL forceMoving)
If you are seriously considering using this component, it would be a great idea to extend this proc to be more versatile/less overpowered - the mobs that currently implement this benefit the most
since they are weak as shit with only five health. Up to you though, don't take what's written here as gospel.</td></tr></table></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/Skyrat-SS13/Skyrat-tg/tree/e507f9120bb0c3beecfe169d14193d90e7229a58">e507f91</a> (master) â€” <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.9.0</a></footer></body></html>
