 * * priority - what is this effect's priority to other stun absorptions? higher = more priority
 * * message - optional, "other message" arg of visible message, shown on trigger. Use %EFFECT_OWNER if you want the owner's name to be inserted.
 * * self_message - optional, "self message" arg of visible message, shown on trigger
 * * examine_message - optional, what is shown on examine of the mob.
 * * max_seconds_of_stuns_blocked - optional, how many seconds of stuns can it block before deleting? the stun that breaks over this number is still blocked, even if it is much higher.
 * * delete_after_passing_max - optional, if TRUE, after passing the max seconds of stuns blocked, we will delete ourself.
 * If FALSE, we will instead recharge after some time.
 * * recharge_time - optional, if [delete_after_passing_max] is FALSE, this is how long we will wait before recharging.
 * does nothing if [delete_after_passing_max] is TRUE.
