/**
 * Deployable - Bring your big guns with you, and smack em' down where you want.
 *
 * Allows items to spawn other items (usually objects) in front of the user after a short delay.
 * If attaching this to something:
 * Set deploy_time to a number in seconds for the deploy delay
 * Set thing_to_be_deployed to an obj path for the thing that gets spawned
 * Multiple deployments and deployments work together to allow a thing to be placed down several times. If multiple deployments is false then don't worry about deployments
 * Direction setting true means the object spawned will face the direction of the person who deployed it, false goes to the default direction
