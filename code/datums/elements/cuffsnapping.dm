/**
 * cuffsnapping element replaces the item's secondary attack with an aimed attack at the kneecaps under certain circumstances.
 *
 * Element is incompatible with non-items. Requires the parent item to have a force equal to or greater than WOUND_MINIMUM_DAMAGE.
 * Also requires that the parent can actually get past pre_secondary_attack without the attack chain cancelling.
 *
 * cuffsnapping attacks have a wounding bonus between severe and critical+10 wound thresholds. Without some serious wound protecting
 * armour this all but guarantees a wound of some sort. The attack is directed specifically at a limb and the limb takes the damage.
 *
 * Requires the cutter_user to be aiming for either leg zone, which will be targeted specifically. They will than have a 3-second long
 * do_after before executing the attack.
 *
 * cuffsnapping requires the target to either be on the floor, immobilised or buckled to something. And also to have an appropriate leg.
 *
 * Passing all the checks will cancel the entire attack chain.
