/*
	The presence of this element allows an item (or a projectile carrying an item) to embed itself in a carbon when it is thrown into a target (whether by hand, gun, or explosive wave) with either
	at least 4 throwspeed (EMBED_THROWSPEED_THRESHOLD) or ignore_throwspeed_threshold set to TRUE. Items meant to be used as shrapnel for projectiles should have ignore_throwspeed_threshold set to true.

	Whether we're dealing with a direct /obj/item (throwing a knife at someone) or an /obj/projectile with a shrapnel_type, how we handle things plays out the same, with one extra step separating them.
	Items simply make their COMSIG_MOVABLE_IMPACT_ZONE check, while projectiles check on COMSIG_PROJECTILE_SELF_ON_HIT.
	Upon a projectile hitting a valid target, it spawns whatever type of payload it has defined, then has that try to embed itself in the target on its own.

	Otherwise non-embeddable or stickable items can be made embeddable/stickable through wizard events/sticky tape/admin memes.

 *
 * The reason for this extra mucking about is avoiding having to do an extra hitby(), and annoying the target by impacting them once with the projectile, then again with the shrapnel, and possibly
 * AGAIN if we actually embed. This way, we save on at least one message.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * embedding_item- the item we're trying to insert into the target
 * * target- what we're trying to shish-kabob, either a bodypart or a carbon
 * * hit_zone- if our target is a carbon, try to hit them in this zone, if we don't have one, pick a random one. If our target is a bodypart, we already know where we're hitting.
 * * forced- if we want this to succeed 100%
