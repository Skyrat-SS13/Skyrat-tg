Congratulations! You have been picked to be the Sole Survivor of an anti-Nanotrasen suicide mission!
We're kidding of course, these types of missions tend to have abnormally high survival rates. I guess that says a lot about who your team will be going up against.
<br>
You've been assigned to provide intelligence support to the ground-pounders carrying out the operation.
Each operative has been equipped with a bodycam that can be accessed via your Overwatch Camera Console.
Additionally, you have been given the boards to access station alerts, cameras, and remotely control the infiltrator shuttle.
<br>
Feel free to set up your workplace however you like. We've provided the tools and boards in your backroom.
<br>
Happy hunting!
