		<i>Most of the scroll's contents are unintelligible, plagued with mold, milk stains and a stench of spolied goat cheese so potent,<br>
		you can barely resist turning your head to retch. What's left of the writings is vague and abstract, as if the author<br>
		was in a mad dash to pass on their findings.<br><br>
		However, the runes they have managed to scribe onto the parchment are oddly untouched by time, and remain distinct.<br>
		You also discover a schema for a more widely-used Grand Ritual rune, however it is dotted with yellow circles, which in turn are<br>
		filled with black dots. Are these supposed to be... <b>cheese wheels?..</b><br><br>
		As you finish skimming through the wreck that is this scroll, you hear a faint snicker somewhere beyond your mind's eye...</i><br>
