		Summoning a dark matter meteor.<br>

		Operative, this crate contains 10+1 spare meteor shield satellites stolen from NT’s supply lines. Your mission is to
		deploy them in space near the station and recalibrate them with the provided emag. Be careful: you need a 30 second
		cooldown between each hack, and NT will detect your interference after seven recalibrations. That means you
		have at least 5 minutes of work and 1 minute of resistance.<br>
		<br>
		This is a high-risk operation. You’ll need backup, fortification, and determination. The reward?
		A spectacular dark matter singularity that will wipe out the station.<br>
