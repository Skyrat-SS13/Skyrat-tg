		"\[00:42\] But the title brings with it all the prestige and responsibility of some kind of fucking manchild kindergarten teacher",
		"\[00:55\] To think Nanotrasen loves to call this hellhole:",
		"\[01:03\] A state of the art orbital plasma research facility",
		"\[01:10\] If I remember correctly though",
