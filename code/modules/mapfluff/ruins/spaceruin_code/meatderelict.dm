Initial experiments have determined the sample to be a creature never previously recorded. It weighs approximately 7 grams and seems to be docile. Initial examinations determine that it is an extremely fast replicating organism which can alter its physiology to take multiple differing shapes. \[Recording Terminated\]<br/>- Dr. Phil Cornelius",

It has failed to respond to Light, Heat, Cold, Oxygen, Plasma, CO2, Nitrogen. It, within moments, seemed to have generated muscle tissue within its otherwise shapeless form and moved away from the source of electricity. Feeding the creature has been a simple matter, it consumed just about any form of protein. It appears to rapidly digest and convert forms of protein into more of itself. Any undigestible products are simply left alone. Will continue to monitor creature and provide reports to Nanotrasen Central Command. \[Recording Terminated\]<br/>- Dr. Phil Cornelius",
