/*eigenstate themed Chem
 *Teleports you to the creation location on consumption and back when the reagent is removed from you
 *OD teleports you randomly around the Station and gives you a status effect
 *The status effect slowly send you on a wild ride and replaces you with an alternative reality version of yourself unless you consume eigenstasium/bluespace dust/stabilising agent.
 *During the process you get really hungry,
 *Then some of your items slowly start teleport around you,
 *then alternative versions of yourself are brought in from a different universe and they yell at you.
 *and finally you yourself get teleported to an alternative universe, and character your playing is replaced with said alternative
 *Spraying this on lockers allows you to create eigenlinked lockers - see the eigenstate subsystem for using this to create your own links
