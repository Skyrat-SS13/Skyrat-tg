 *
 * What do I mean by fantasy?
 * * Items will have random qualities assigned to them
 * * Good quality items will have positive buffs/special powers applied to them
 * * Bad quality items will get the opposite!
 * * All of this is reflected in a fitting name for the item
 * * See fantasy.dm and read the component for more information :)
