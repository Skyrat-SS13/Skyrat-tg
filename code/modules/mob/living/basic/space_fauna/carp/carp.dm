/**
 * ## Space Carp
 *
 * A migratory dwarf fortress reference who swim through space and sometimes bump into the space station.
 * Can be created in dehydrated form by traitors, and are also summoned through rifts by space dragons.
 *
 * Begin regenerating their health after a short time without taking any damage, and will try to run away to do this if they get hurt.
 * Lethally attracted to loose plastic.
 *
 * Tameable by feeding them meat, and can follow basic instructions. Rideable.
 * Owned as a pet both by the HoS (sometimes) and also the Nuclear Operatives.
