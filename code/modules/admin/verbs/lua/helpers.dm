/**
 * Byondapi hooks act as "set waitfor = 0" procs. This means that whenever
 * a proc directly called from an external library sleeps, the hook returns with whatever
 * the called proc had as its return value at the moment it slept. This may not
 * be desired behavior, so this datum exists to wrap these procs.
 *
 * Some procs that don't sleep could take longer than the execution limit would
 * allow for. We can wrap these in a promise as well.
