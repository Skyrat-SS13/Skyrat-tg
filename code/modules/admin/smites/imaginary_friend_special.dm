 * Custom imaginary friend.
 *
 * Allows the admin to select the ckey to put into the imaginary friend and whether the imaginary friend looks like the
 * ckey's character.
 *
 * Is not tied to the brain trauma and can be used on all mobs, technically. Including cyborgs and simple/basic mobs.
 *
 * Warranty void if used on AI eyes or other imaginary friends. Please smite responsibly.
