 * The HUB idles until it receives information. It then passes on that information

 * This is the heart of the Telecommunications Network, sending information where it
 * is needed. It mainly receives information from long-distance Relays and then sends
 * that information to be processed. Afterwards it gets the uncompressed information
 * from Servers/Buses and sends that back to the relay, to then be broadcasted.
