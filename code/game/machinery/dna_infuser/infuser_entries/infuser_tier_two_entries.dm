/*
 * Tier two entries are unlocked after infusing someone/being infused and achieving a bonus, and are for dna mutants that are:
 * - harder to acquire (gondolas) but not *necessarily* requiring job help
 * - have a bonus for getting past a threshold
 *
 * todos for the future:
 * - tier threes, requires xenobio cooperation, unlocked after getting a tier two entity bonus
 * - when completing a tier, add the bonus to an xp system for unlocking new tiers. so instead of getting/giving a tier 1 bonus and unlocking tier 2, tier 1 would add "1" to a total. when you have a total of say, 3, you get the next tier
