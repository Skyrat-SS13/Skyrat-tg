/**
 * Camera console used to control a base building drone
 *
 * Using this console will put the user in control of a [base building drone][/mob/camera/ai_eye/remote/base_construction].
 * The drone will appear somewhere within the allowed_area var, or if no area is specified, at the location of the console.area
 * Upon interacting, the user will be granted a set of base building actions that will generally be carried out at the drone's location.
 * To create a new base builder system, this class should be the only thing that needs to be subtyped.
