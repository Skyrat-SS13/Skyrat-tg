##Player controlled mob spawn text
PC_MOB_TEXT As a player controlled mob you are expected to play the role to the best of your ability. This means if you're an animal, act like one. You shouldn't display much intelligence if any. This also means if you're engaging in combat you should refrain from mercing people fully. Play not to win but to create a challenge. You're there to replace AI, make others enjoy the situation as well. If your simple mob is not above simple or mute intelligence, using structures such as welding tanks/canisters/boxes to hinder your opponent is entirely forbidden. Do not do this.
