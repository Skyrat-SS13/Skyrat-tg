Did you know? The Freshness jar of natural baits actually contains kronkaine.
Legends say The Dude once lost his wallet inside a toilet.
Legends say a famous pirate once lost his precious coffer by the Beach.
You could buy fish dirt cheap from the black market, but you probably won't get anything actually fresh.
Rescue hooks can be used to snag in other people. Good for getting husks out of plasma rivers.
Pufferfish are known for the slow yet lethal poison they store inside their liver.
Magnet hooks are great to fish anything that's NOT a fish.
You can perform scanning experiments with an experi-scanner and some fish. They'll give sci some extra techweb points and get you more modules for the fishing portal generator. 
Fish scanning experiments can be automatically performed with an advanced fishing rod. However to print one you need to have at least completed the first one.
Advanced fishing rods come pre-equipped with a unexhaustible bait that ignores bait preferences of each fish, letting you catch'em all.
Don't expect to be able to catch a lot of fish without a bait.
Some fish (mostly predators) are strictly carnivorous and will ignore baits not made of meat or seafood, a few are picky eaters and will only go after the best of baits, while another smaller few are more or less strictly herbivore.
You can fish at the holodeck beach, if you don't mind the fish being quite fake.
You may find worms by digging through sand, ash and snow.
You can revive fish by using a Lazarus Injector on them. However, using Strange Reagent would be a smarter option here.
You can feed fish outside of an aquarium by tapping them with a can of fish feed.
More fishing rods and fish cases can be printed at the autolathe.
Seeking alternative ways to catch fish without bothering to do it yourself? Explosives can be thrown at fishing spots to get several (dead) fishes in a pinch.
You can raise lobstrosities from chasm chrabs. However, lobstrosities can only be tamed with spare limbs or lavaloop fish while still young.
Lavaloop fish make for dangerous yet somewhat effective throwing weapons against big fauna.
The fishing portal generator has different modules, all of which can be unlocked by completing fish scanning experiments... except for the Syndicate one...
A fish's traits influence how you can catch them. Carnivore fish will ignore dough balls, and herbivore fish ignore anything that's not from botany.
Telescopic fishing rods can be bought from cargo.
Once grown from chrabs and tamed, lobstrosities can be heeded to fish on fishing spots for you.
Aquariums can be upgraded to bioelectricity generators can a specific kit. From there, you can add electric-generating fish like the anxious zip zap to generate power.
Getting better at fishing will net you some small additional advantages, such as receiving more information when examining a fish or a fishing spot.
The size and weight of a fish can influence the amount of reagents and fillets you can harvest from them, their force as a weapon and how easy it is to store them in containers.
While most fish make for shoddy weapons, a few, like the swordfish and the chainsawfish, can be quite powerful. In general, the bigger they are, the more forceful they get.
Fish can be sold to cargo. While most don't sell for very much, the biggest ones can be sold for a considerable bounty.
The meat of fish like swordfish, salmon and pufferfish (weren't they poisonous) makes for an excellent ingredient that boosts the quality of the end product.
Stingrays are known for their stinger, which they use to deliver venom to hostiles.
Some species of fish can be bred into new species under the right conditions.
Most fish don't survive outside water, so get them somewhere safe like an aquarium or a fish case, or even a toilet or a moisture trap!
No matter how you look at it, most people won't care about fishing. Don't let that stop you. They're just jealous.
To fish on ice you have to puncture the ice layer with a pick or shovel first.
Depending on the kind of fish inside it and whether they're alive or dead, an aquarium can improve the beauty of the room or worsen it.
Almost all fish can be ground in an All-in-one-Grinder. Don't think too hard about how you're fitting a giant fish into a blender. Nanotrasen technology is weird like that.
The sludgefish from the toilets can be used as a steady supply of cheap fish and fillets due to its self-reproducing behaviour. However it's quite fragile.
In a jiffy, you can scoop tadpoles from ponds with your bare hands, place them inside aquariums and quickly raise them into frogs.
The legendary fishing hat isn't just cosmetic. Space carps (as well as young lobstrosities and frogs) do truly fear those who wear it.
Have you ever heard a lobster or crab talk? Well, neither have I, but they say they're quite the fishy punsters.
You can get an experiscanner from science to perform fish scanning experiments, which can unlock more modules for the fishing portal, as well as fishing technology nodes (better equipment) for research.
